# Time Frame


# Back end
1. Collect Data 
	- Might need web scrapping
	- If we have access to files (csv, excel etc) simple python, shell program can 'extract' raw data
	- Later we can use AI to process data
2. Auto - update part
	- Use AI..(I'm not sure)
	- Should be updated every custom time
	- Support multiple sources?
3. Testing

# Frontend
1. Showing up data
	- What graph/table are we using to express
	- Are we gonna need some "text" as well
	- Design or theme
	- Support hyperlinks (leading to multiple pages)
	- Citation


## Data
- What type of data needed
	- Renewable energy - definition
	- Types (Solar, Wind....)
- Data Source
### Core Data
#### NEM
-https://opennem.org.au/energy/nem/?range=7d&interval=30m

- State break
	- Supply by Fuel Type
	- Demand by Fuel Type
	- Compare renewable and non-renewable energy usage
	- Repeat for supply and demand

-https://aemo.com.au/energy-systems/electricity/national-electricity-market-nem/data-nem/aggregated-data

- State break

- Demand, supply for every sources, and region
- Use data to make graph

### Optional
- Extra stuff : solar panel (distribution, efficiency etc)

[^1]: Collecting data on the progress of renewable energy in Australia involves gathering information from various sources, including government agencies, research institutions, industry reports, and more. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to collect data on renewable energy progress in Australia:

1. Define Your Objectives: Start by clearly defining the specific aspects of renewable energy progress you want to collect data on. This could include metrics such as electricity generation, capacity additions, investment trends, policy developments, and environmental impacts.
    
2. Identify Data Sources: Identify the key sources of data that can provide information on renewable energy in Australia. Some of the most valuable sources include:
    
    - Government agencies: Access data from agencies like the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), and the Clean Energy Regulator.
    - Research institutions: Look for reports and studies published by universities, think tanks, and research organizations specializing in renewable energy.
    - Industry reports: Industry associations and consulting firms often release reports on the renewable energy sector.
    - Energy companies: Some energy companies and utilities may publish data related to their renewable energy projects and production.
3. Online Databases: Explore online databases and portals that provide renewable energy statistics. For example, the Australian Renewable Energy Mapping Infrastructure (AREMI) provides data on renewable energy projects and resources.
    
4. Government Websites: Visit relevant government websites to access official reports, data sets, and publications related to renewable energy policies and projects. This includes websites like the Department of Industry, Science, Energy, and Resources.
    
5. Academic Journals: Search academic journals for peer-reviewed research articles on renewable energy topics in Australia. These sources can provide valuable insights and data.
    
6. Industry Publications: Look for publications and magazines dedicated to the renewable energy industry in Australia. These often contain news, reports, and data relevant to your research.
    
7. Surveys and Questionnaires: Consider conducting surveys or questionnaires if you need specific information that is not readily available from existing sources. Reach out to relevant stakeholders, including government agencies, industry associations, and renewable energy companies.
    
8. Data Aggregation: Aggregate the data you collect into a structured format for analysis. This may involve cleaning, formatting, and organizing the data into a spreadsheet or database.
    
9. Analyze the Data: Analyze the collected data to draw insights and conclusions about the progress of renewable energy in Australia. You can use statistical analysis tools, data visualization software, and other analytics techniques to aid in this process.
    
10. Keep Updated: Renewable energy is a dynamic field with evolving trends and developments. Regularly check for updates and new data to ensure your information remains current.
    
11. Citations and References: When using data from external sources, make sure to provide proper citations and references in your reports or research to maintain academic and ethical integrity.
    
12. Data Privacy and Ethics: Respect data privacy and ethical considerations when collecting and using data. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access and use any data, especially if it involves personal or sensitive information. (BY CHAT GPT)
