SCIF3000 CSIRO Project

## Goal
create a web-page about the growth of renewable energy in Australia. It could contain historic aspects, latest developments and even predictions about the future. The use of AI would allow that the web-page is automatically updated without a person needed to have a look at it.

- Build a web app with "descent design"
    - https://www.nem-watch.info/widgets/reneweconomy/
- Supports external link
- Use AI so that site auto updates itself (optional)

### ToDo
(1) where to get the data

(2) how to scrape that automatically with AI,

(3) what kind of presentation would the average consumer be most interested in?
